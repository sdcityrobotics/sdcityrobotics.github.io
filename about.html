<p>San Diego City College Robotics team members are studying a variety of disciplines, 
including engineering, computer science, and physics.  We compete in the RoboSub 
competition, which is held at the SPAWAR Systems Center Pacific TRANSDEC facility 
in San Diego.  Our team designs, builds, tests, and deploys an Autonomous Underwater 
Vehicle (AUV) for the competition.  The vehicle is designed to complete a series of 
tasks using information provided by its acoustic and visual sensors.</p>
